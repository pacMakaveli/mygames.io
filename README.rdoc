## The reason

If you're like me, you probably have 100+ games and you manage them through an excel,
or something like that.

A spreadsheet is okish, but it's hard to maintain and looks pretty shit.

That's why I created games.directory .. It's a simple personal 'spreadsheet' of
your games which can be transformed is something pretty cool. You can create collections,
whishlists and so on..
